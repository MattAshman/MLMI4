# MLMI4: Advanced Machine Learning
Implementation of *Doubly Stochastic Variational Inference in Deep Gaussian Processes*. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08933).

## TODO:
* Run the UCI experiments.
* Implement image completion as in Conditional Neural Processes.
* Compare performance with Power EP method by Thang Bui.
* Thoroughly understand both DGPs and Power EP, and how Doubly Stochastic Variational inference for DGPs is a special case of Power EP.
